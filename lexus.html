Introducing the lexus 570,it's no secret that the LX is a fancified Toyota Land Cruiser, but there's plenty to demarcate this luxury-brand model from the mainstream version. Lexus takes advantage of the Land Cruiser's off-road-ready capability and its a family-friendly SUV. It has a refined and premium cabin, and a suite of driver-assistance features. The LX's blend of off-road capability, size XL luxury, and V-8 power.The LX serves its specific purpose adequately, but there are numerous, more attractive SUV alternatives if your mission requires plushness, a top-shelf image, and three rows of seats.
<br>
To feed the 383-hp 5.7-liter V-8 under the hood, the LX ingests gulps of air, an action that is anything but quiet. When you press the gas pedal heavily, the LX gathers itself with a big whoosh before trotting from zero to 120 km/h in 7.2 seconds. That's sufficient to escape the "slow" label, but the LX is easily bested off the line by many of its competitors. For comparison, the Mercedes-AMG GLS63 leaps to 120 km/h in just 4.3 seconds. The price of the vehicle ranges between Kshs 11m-15m.
<br>
The LX is not a luxury vehicle that allows its driver to sit back, relax, and glide to their destination. Although the ride is comfortable and shrugs off road bumps, the steering is numb and disconnected, and low-speed turns require plenty of arm work.If towing is of serious concern, forget the LX altogether and head to the Toyota dealer for the Land Cruiser. It offers an extra 1100 pounds of capability versus the LX's 7000-pound rating.
